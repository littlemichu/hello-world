First repository

===============

This is my first time using git in a long long time.

Hello World!

Hmm, a little (or a lot!) about myself:
I like almost everything except horror movies, bugs and football (American).

Hobbies include:
- artsy/craft things: knitting, sketching, terrorizing my friend's hair, building models
- moving around: dancing, hiking, most sports (I enjoy - not necessarily good at!)
- reading: fantasy (magic and dragons!), cs lewis, the Bible
- talking with friends: no explanation needed :P

My goals:
- to love my neighbor as myself
- to become a great developer and make contributions to the world!!!
- to become a math teacher someday
